    - 60% Operations (routine tasks)
    - 25% Incidents (urgent issues)
    - 15% Projects (planned work)
    
    Priority distribution:
    - 10% Critical/P1
    - 20% High/P2  
    - 50% Medium/P3
    - 20% Low/P4
    """
```

#### 1.3 Story Point Estimation Logic
- Implement realistic estimation based on:
  - Ticket complexity and scope
  - Required skill level and specialization
  - Dependencies on other team members or external systems
  - Historical data patterns for similar work
  - Risk factors and potential complications

### Phase 2: Sprint Planning Simulation

#### 2.1 Triage Process Simulation
```python
def simulate_triage_meeting():
    """
    Model realistic triage discussions:
    1. Priority assessment based on business impact
    2. Resource allocation considering team skills
    3. Dependency identification and sequencing
    4. Risk assessment for complex tickets
    5. Capacity planning against team availability
    """
```

#### 2.2 Decision-Making Factors
- **Business Impact Assessment:** Critical systems vs. nice-to-have features
- **Resource Availability:** Team member specializations and current workload
- **Technical Dependencies:** Prerequisites and blocking factors
- **Stakeholder Pressure:** Executive priorities and customer commitments
- **Technical Debt Considerations:** Long-term maintenance vs. quick fixes

#### 2.3 Sprint Commitment Algorithm

- Account for planned time off, meetings, and administrative overhead
- Reserve capacity for urgent incidents and unplanned work
- Balance between operations tickets and strategic project work

### Phase 3: Daily Work Execution Simulation

#### 3.1 Realistic Work Patterns
```python
class DailyWorkSimulator:
    def simulate_work_day(self, team_member, assigned_tickets, day):
        """
        Model realistic daily patterns:
        - Morning: Email review, standup, planning
        - Mid-morning: Deep work on primary assignments
        - Afternoon: Collaboration, meetings, ticket updates
        - End of day: Documentation, next-day planning
        
        Include realistic interruptions:
        - Urgent tickets requiring immediate attention
        - Collaboration requests from team members
        - Stakeholder questions and clarifications
        - Technical blockers requiring research or escalation
        """
```

#### 3.2 Complication and Challenge Modeling
- **Technical Blockers:** Unexpected complexity or missing information
- **External Dependencies:** Vendor support, third-party integrations
- **Scope Creep:** Requirements changes during implementation
- **Resource Conflicts:** Multiple high-priority items competing for attention
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Learning time for new technologies or processes

#### 3.3 Collaboration Patterns

- **Knowledge Transfer:** Senior engineers sharing expertise
- **Escalation Chains:** Junior → Senior → Manager decision flow
- **Cross-functional Work:** Projects requiring multiple specializations

### Phase 4: Logging and Documentation Generation

#### 4.1 Timestamp-Based Activity Logs
```python
def generate_realistic_timestamp_logs():
    """
    Create detailed activity logs with:
    - Accurate business hours (8:00 AM - 6:00 PM)
    - Realistic work patterns and break times
    - Meeting blocks and collaboration periods
    - After-hours incident response when applicable
    - Detailed actions with specific technical activities
    """
```
