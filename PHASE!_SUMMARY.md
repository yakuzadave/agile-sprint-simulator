# Phase 1 Summary: Pre-Sprint Setup & Ticket Generation

This document summarizes the work completed in Phase 1, including the creation of the pre-sprint analysis script,
migration to Pydantic data models, and the establishment of a project setup with virtual environment support.

## Work Performed

- **Pre‑Sprint Analysis Script**: Added `generate_pre_sprint_analysis.py`, a CLI tool that:
  - Builds the default team composition (six members).
  - Generates a realistic backlog of ServiceNow/Jira tickets via `TicketGenerator`.
  - Outputs `pre_sprint_analysis.md` containing:
    - A markdown table of tickets (ID, source, priority, category, estimates, dependencies, descriptions).
    - A team capacity & skill matrix table.
    - A capacity planning summary (team size & total FTE).
    - Placeholders for triage meeting notes and sprint commitment (Phase 2).

- **Pydantic Data Models**: Refactored core domain classes to use Pydantic:
  - `Ticket` model in `ticket_system.py` (typed attributes, default factories).
  - `TeamMember` model in `team_members.py` (typed fields, default values).

- **Bug Fixes**: Updated ticket instantiation to pass keyword arguments to `Ticket(...)` to comply with Pydantic's `BaseModel` API.

- **Project Setup Enhancements**:
  - Created `requirements.txt` (pins `pydantic>=1.10`).
  - Added `.gitignore` to exclude virtual environments, caches, build artifacts, and `.env`.
  - Added `README.md` with:
    - Virtual environment setup instructions.
    - Phase 1 usage examples.
    - Reference to full specification in `AGENTS.md`.
